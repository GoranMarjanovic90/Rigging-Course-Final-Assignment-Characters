All parts are grouped separately in Outliner. For example, "RightLeg_Grp" contains IK, FK, and blend groups to be accessible as separate entities. This structure ensures that different animation controls remain as their own entities and easily selectable without assaulting other rig elements. Controls are grouped separately so they can be found and accessed more easily when animating or adjusting the character. This setup is not just for organization but is essential for workflow efficiency, allowing quick selection and movement of key elements. The separation of IK and FK controls helps to keep the rig clean and prevents unnecessary dependencies between different systems while still allowing for smooth switching and blending when needed. By structuring the rig this way, I can quickly manipulate the parts I need without affecting unrelated elements, making the rig more efficient to work with.
